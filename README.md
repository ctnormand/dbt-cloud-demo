# dbt Cloud Demo

This demo project showcases how organizations can leverage **dbt Cloud** to maximize the value of their data operations. The dbt project is a fork of dbt Labs' [Jaffle Shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop). I extended the project using **Terraform** to deploy the necessary infrastructure to Snowflake. This pattern of incorporating infrastructure-as-code in the data platform is another way organizations can improve collaboration and visibility at scale.

## Repository Structure
